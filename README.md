# degMath.js
Anyone here that isn't used to radians? Yea me too

## Usage

**Example:**
```js
/* d.Math(oprt,deg) */
d.Math(sin,90)
// Result: 1
```
First parameter is the operation you want to use with degrees, such as sin, cos and tan (any anything else that runs on radians.)

And that's pretty much all this has to offer, some measly lines of code so that i don't have to add ` * Math.PI/180` to everything that needs radians.
## Installation

To use degMath.js in your own projects, just drop this into your html:
```html
<script src="https://cooliokid956.github.io/degMath.js/degMath.min.js"></script>
